First Odin Project.

What we're looking for to start with here:

1    Two ways to move a div around on the page <br>
2    Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page<br>
3    Identify the background color of an existing webpage<br>
4    Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage<br>
5    Center an element horizontally<br>
6    Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page<br>
7    Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page<br>
8    Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)
